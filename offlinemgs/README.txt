**Offline message**

Two core function are implemented:

1. Server can save message for offline clients (not connecting to the server).
2. Stored message can be forwarded to client once they get connected to the server.

To run the script, simply download it and save it at a convenient location on your computer.
Both the server and client script can then be run from the Command prompt (in Windows) 
or from bash terminal (Linux users) by simply typing "python server.py" and "python client.py"

The IP address and port in the server and client file has been automatically set to "127.0.0.1" and "3000" respectively.
The aim of this is to ease the use of the online chat system.
So you only need to enter only your username to start chatting.

How to run server.py :
$ python server.py

How to run client.py
$ python client.py
Enter username
