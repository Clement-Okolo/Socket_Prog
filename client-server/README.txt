**Client-Server Communication using TCP/IP 
            & Advanced Client**

Two core functions are implemented:

1. Server and client communicating with each other through socket programming using TCP/IP.
2. Client sending and receiving messages at the same time with less CPU workload.

To run the script, simply download it and save it at a convenient location on your computer.
Both the server and client script can then be run from the Command prompt (in Windows) 
or from bash terminal (Linux users) by simply typing "python server.py" and "python client.py"

The IP address and port in the server and client file has been automatically set to "127.0.0.1" and "3000" respectively.
The aim of this is to ease the use of the online chat system.
So you only need to enter only your username to start chatting.

Start Chating with any other client connected to the server
