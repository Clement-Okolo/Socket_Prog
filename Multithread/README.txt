Multi-Thread Communication Server

One core function is implemented:

1. Multiple students to discuss class topics or homework problems at the same time.

To run the script, simply download it and save it at a convenient location on your computer.
Both the server and client script can then be run from the Command prompt (in Windows) 
or from bash terminal (Linux users) by simply typing "python server.py" and "python client.py"

At this point, server is able to support concurrent connections with multiple clients.
The IP address and port in the server and client file has been automatically set to "127.0.0.1" and "3000" respectively.
So you do not need to enter IP address and port to start chatting. 
You will be connected automatically to the server.
The aim of this is to ease the use of the online chat system.

How to run server file :
$ python server.py


How to run client file:
$ python client.py
Start chating with other multilple students connected to the server
