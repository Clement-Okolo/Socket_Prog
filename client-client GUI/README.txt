**Client-Client Communication**

Clients communicate with each other by passing messages through the server.
Three core functions are implemented:

1. Client management.
2. Receive message from a sending client.
3. Forward message to a receiving client.

To run the script, simply download it and save it at a convenient location on your computer.
Both the server and client script can then be run from the Command prompt (in Windows) 
or from bash terminal (Linux users) by simply typing "python server.py" and "python client.py"

The IP address and port in the server and client file has been automatically set to "127.0.0.1" and "3000" respectively.
The aim of this is to ease the use of the online chat system.
So you only need to enter only your username to start chatting.

How to run server file :
$ python server.py


How to run client file:
$ python client.py
Enter your prefered username in GUI chatbox
Start Chating with any other client connected to the server
Type {quit} exits the GUI chat
